**Speaker diarisation** ([or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29) **diarization**) is the process of partitioning an input audio stream into homogeneous segments according to the speaker identity. It can enhance the readability of an [automatic speech transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition) by structuring the audio stream into speaker turns and, when used together with [speaker recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_recognition) systems, by providing the speaker’s true identity.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_diarisation#cite_note-1) It is used to answer the question "who spoke when?"[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_diarisation#cite_note-2) Speaker diarisation is a combination of speaker segmentation and speaker clustering. The first aims at finding speaker change points in an audio stream. The second aims at grouping together speech segments on the basis of speaker characteristics.
